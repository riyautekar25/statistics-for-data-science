--> What is descriptive statistics?
As the name suggest it describes features of your data such as centarl tendancy (mean, median, mode) and variability (range, standard deviation and variance).


--> Purpose:
1. Summarize large datasets
2. Provide foundation for more complex statistical anaysis (inferential statistics, wil cover this later)

TOPIC 1:
CENTRAL TENDENCY
A single center value of your data that represents or summarizes entire dataset.
Mean: Average value of your data : When to use: Numerical data + roughly symmetrical data + NO extreme outliers --> NOTE** MEAN is affected by outliers
Median: Middle value when data is sorted: When to use: Numerical data + outliers are present + Data is skewed + you want typical value --> Median is robust to outliers
Mode: Most frequent value in your data: When to use: Categorical Data (can be used in Numerical case also) + you want most common cases
